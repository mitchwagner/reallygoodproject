# Mission

The Really Good Project is an on-going effort to bring together individuals
devoted to the pursuit of excellence and truth- to self-edification, and
to understanding and discovery.

It is our hope that, by inculcating these objects in ourselves, we might
find ourselves the better for it; and that, by realizing such principles
in our daily acts and associations with others, we might promote them
throughout society, and so collectively attain a more compassionate
existence, rooted in reason, understanding, and purpose.

# Initiatives

The Project is comprised of two primary initiatives. Each is aimed at
fostering those values imperative to individual growth: curiosity,
contemplation, and above all, humility. However, each has its own particular
focus:

## Really Good Tutorials

Really Good Tutorials (RGT) is a community centered on sharing and discovering
the incontrovertible (viz., mathematics), and for relating observations of the
natural world- scientific theories and the evidence in their favor, to include
those views that predominate and those that dissent from the consensus. 

RGT is a platform designed to facilitate high-quality, effective communication
of the above, with an emphasis on clarity, precision, and correctness. It is
_not_ a place for hyperbole or emotion, nor for even sober assessments as to
what is right, good and true, and what is not. Rather, it is a place only for
reporting what others have seen and said, and what may meanginfully be
established as irrefutably true or false.

The only judgments to be passed on RGT are those critiques, supported by
evidence, that dispute the veracity and faithfulness of information presented.

## Really Good Forum

By contrast, the Really Good Forum (RGF) is meant to be, as the name suggests,
the home of argumentation: a place of self-discovery, rhetorical persuasion,
and dialectic inquiry. It a place where curious discussion of ideas, rooted in
individual sensibilities of value, take place. 

And yet, the object of RGF is not prevailing- not in the slightest. Rather, it
is intended to promote the understanding of the self and of others- to help
mold one's own individual notions of value, worth and meaning, and to instill a
sense of respect for those of others. The community exhortation: to abhor the
absolute, making no statements of fact, but instead, endeavoring that all
conversation should reflect our limited reference frames.
